# BBR' Changelog

v1.5 - Changed BW window culling to use packet-timed round trip time
       instead of wall-clock round trip time.  Wall-clock remains a
       config option.

v1.4 - Updated BBR' PktsAcked() to ignore acks when sending time 
       unknown.

v1.3 - Re-worked RTT and BW windows to use actual times.
       Added configuration option for pacing/non-pacing/tcp-pacing.
     
v1.2 - Re-factored state code to use FSM for BBR states.

v1.1 - Added PROBE_RTT state.

v1.0 - Initial version.
